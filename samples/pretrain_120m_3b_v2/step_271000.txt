 In a distant future, humans and robots ó are going to be able to live in the future.
"We need to make sure that our technology is working so that we can continue to develop and refine it," said Martin Lipson, a mechanical engineer at the University of California-Los Angeles. "The new technologies will enable us to create more advanced life forms."
He said the technology would also help scientists understand how cells function in space, such as the human heart.
"It's very exciting because you can see how these cells work together to form new life forms," he said.
The research was funded by the National Science Foundation, the National Institutes of Health, and the National Science Education Technology Center.

 Oct. 7, 2008 Scientists have found that the DNA of humans' skulls might be the genetic blueprint for the development of a brain.
The findings could lead to new treatments for Alzheimer's disease, according to senior author Dr. Roxanne Geeks of the University of Texas Medical Branch, who led the study.

 If all cats are animals and some animals are black, can we conclude that some cats are black?
Answer: Yes. Some cats are black, but others are not. However, the black cat is a species of cat. The black cat is black in color, and the white cat is white in color. In fact, it is a very rare species of cat to be found in North America and Europe. It is not a cat because it is a black cat.
Answers: There are many cats in North America who are black or white.
The black cat is one of the most common cats in North American. It is a black, fat cat with a short tail. It has a long tail which is also called a "cat." It is a very important cat for people to understand about this cat as well as other cats.
Another common dog in North America is the wolf. This dog is very active and can run at speeds up to 10 mph. It is usually seen in areas where there is a lot of ground to cover, such as areas of dense vegetation. It is also known as a cat because of its size.
An alternative way to tell a cat is by looking at the black cat. This will show you what a cat looks like when you look at it. You should always ask your veterinarian if you have any questions or concerns about
