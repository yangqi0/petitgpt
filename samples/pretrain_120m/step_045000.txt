 Once upon a time, aimed the key. It was a very special key that could unlock any door in the world. One day, an intelligent key came to the door and said: "If you want to unlock this door, I will help you!" The key thought for a moment then answered: "Yes, please tell me where you are!" So the key opened the door and inside it went! To everyone's surprise, there were lots of interesting things to see and do. They all played games together, like hide-and-seek and tag. At the end of the day, the key unlocked itself and all the doors opened again. Everyone was so happy and thanked the key for unlocking the door. From then on, the key was known as the key to unlocking doors. It was the most amazing key in the world!

We may have to remember that some kids are bad teachers and the kids can easily get along with them as they are. We should not worry about the kid being too bad, but if he can make it right.
