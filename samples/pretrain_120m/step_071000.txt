 Once upon a time, aimed a human. He was a very brave and strong man who loved to help people. One day he saw an old woman walking down the street. She looked very sad. The human wanted to help her so he ran up to her and said, "What's wrong?" The old woman replied, "I'm feeling very tired." The human thought for a moment then said, "Let me give you a massage!" So the human lay down on the grass and started massaging her body with gentle strokes. After a few minutes, she felt much better. The old woman smiled at the human and said, â€œYou did a great job! You are a very kind and generous person.â€ The human thanked her again and waved goodbye as she walked away. From that day forward, the human never forgot how special it was to give a massage.

 In a distant future, humans and robots  open up their minds to the world of astral, scientifically trained scientists and engineers. They use their knowledge to create new ideas, techniques and tools that are very effective in creating ideas that are always possible to achieve success in life. Here is a guide on how to design your own creative thinking and learning techniques for the sake of an idea. It’s not only about the science behind how we think about what it is or whether we are thinking about something else. You can read more here.
