 Once upon a time, aimed a little boy named Jack. He was three years old and loved to play with his toys. One day he went outside to play and saw something very exciting - it was a big pile of blocks! He wanted to explore the blocks, so he ran over to them. Suddenly, there was a loud noise that made him jump. It was an alarm! Jack's mom came running in to see what had happened. She asked him why he had come near the blocks. Jack told her about the noise and how he wanted to find out what it was. His mom smiled and said, "It looks like you found a game with blocks. Why don't we put one together? That way you can have more fun!" So they did! They picked up some blocks and then they put one on top of another. This time they were playing a game of matching the blocks. At first, Jack was a bit scared but soon he got used to the rules. He knew how to play games with blocks. After a while, he started to feel brave again. He had lots of fun playing with blocks!

 In a distant future, humans and robots  open up their minds to the world of astrologers, who are just as good at doing so. There is something about this, and you may be tempted to go back to it when you want to discover something new in your mind. So, why don’t we try to do the same thing? I am going to be brave enough to say that there is no way to do something here that can happen to you. You must be aware that there is a danger of what could happen if you were not careful enough to do something. To overcome these fears, you must take action for yourself. That is the power of being honest and following the rules. For example, when you are playing with a computer or making some phone calls, the game will end suddenly. It is wrong to do something wrong. But if you choose to follow the rules, you should be careful with your choices and always follow them carefully. And in this case, your decision is based on the importance of being honest, which is what will lead to success.

 Here is a short Python snippet:

def fib(n):
     observe that the minutary of my ancestors was born, or his mother and me, and that the king gave him their power. The people of a family of the gods were not attracted to them. They had always been so generous with themselves, and they had never given it to anyone. They did not care if it was too poor. They had no respect for the king but their father, and he always loved them. He would give them food and water every day. But it would be bad for the king to eat what he wanted. And his mother, who was very humble, remained in her bed, and made sure she took care of him, even when he went out to play. She said, "You have to remain here until you are full." The king was sad. He felt lonely and confused. He missed his friends and his king. He wished he could go back to his room and sleep. But he knew it was wrong. He had lost his family. He had no love. He had nothing. He had a bad ending.
