 Once upon a time, aimed Daisy was feeling very miserable. She had been playing with her toy car and it had come to life! The wind blew gently on the car and made it bounce around in circles. "Wow!" said Daisy, clapping her hands. Suddenly, Daisy's mom came in. "What are you two doing?" asked Mom. Daisy smiled at her mom and said, "I'm not sad anymore." Mom smiled back and said, â€œThat's great, Daisy. Let me help you make sure your toy car is happy again.â€ Daisy smiled and together they made the car go round and round, and Daisy laughed as she watched it bounce. When the car was done, Daisy thanked her mom for helping her. Then she went inside and hugged her new toy car tightly. Daisy felt much better now that her toy car was happy and full of joy. From then on, Daisy always knew how to make things better.

     observe that the "home" of this phenomenon, as it may be, be the real thing. How does this happen? Does this happen when you start to understand the nature of the human soul?

It might be, therefore, very much as I say, a true question about what it is like to live up to the life of an human being. What do we need to understand is what it is. And what the 'new' reality, and how does it happen? If so, what is the existence of this new phenomenon? As with all of this, it is my experience. What I am saying, I know of many things.
