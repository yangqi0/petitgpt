 Once upon a time, aimed a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside in the garden with her toys. One day, she found a big red apple under a tree. It looked so yummy! Lily picked up the apple and took a bite. It was so sweet and juicy! Suddenly, she heard a voice behind her. "Hello there, little one," said the apple. "I am very hungry too. Can I have some of your apple?" Lily smiled and said, "Of course you can!" They sat together and enjoyed the delicious apple while talking about their day. After they finished eating, Lily thanked the apple for being such a good friend. From that day on, whenever Lily saw a red apple, she would always remember how kind it was to share with someone who needed it.
