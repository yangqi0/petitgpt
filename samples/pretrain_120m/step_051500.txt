 Once upon a time, aimed Anna was feeling very sleepy. She went to her bedroom and lay down on her bed. As she closed her eyes, she heard the wind outside. It made her feel happy. Suddenly, a bright light appeared in the room! Anna opened her eyes and saw a beautiful butterfly flying around her. The butterfly said, "Hello, Anna!" Anna laughed and said, "I'm glad you're here." The butterfly asked if it could join her for a game of catch. Anna thought about it for a moment and then said, "Yes, I'd love to play catch with you!" So, they played catch together until the sun set. When it was time for Anna to go back to bed, she gave the butterfly one last hug before saying goodnight. Anna smiled as she watched the butterfly fly away into the night sky.

 In a distant future, humans and robots  open up their minds to the world of robots. But there is one thing that can make a difference: machines are very fast and efficient. They have special powers that they can change into different types of robots and do things with ease. One of these things is how to use them properly. He has a tool that he uses to make robots to help him go faster and more efficiently. The first thing you need to know about robots is that they work in a way that no one else can move around. It’s not easy to use a machine because it can be dangerous and uncomfortable. If you don’t know what they do or how to use it, then why would you use this tool? You should learn how to use robots safely and quickly. If you want to change something, you should use the tool to change your mind. For example, if you want to improve your robot skills, you must also read some books on the computer. This tool helps you learn how to change a robot. Sometimes it will take a few minutes for you to look at the computer and watch it change. However, sometimes it takes time to understand how to use robot skills. When you get the information you need to make sure it doesn’t break, you will find out when
