 Once upon a time, factor was said to be "junk". The motor stopped and the motor started again. This time it was going fast! It went over hills and through fields. Everyone cheered when they saw the motor. They all clapped and shouted "Yay!" The motor kept going faster and faster until it arrived at its destination. When it got there, everyone cheered even louder. They were so happy that the motor had come to them. Then, they ran off in their own way, leaving behind lots of joy and excitement. And they all lived happily ever after!
