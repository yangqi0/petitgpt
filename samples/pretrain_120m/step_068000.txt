 In a distant future, humans and robots  open up their minds to the world of robots. But there is no time for war on the planet. There is only one day, and there is no peace or peace. One day, a new robot arrives at Earth in the middle of the night. He has never seen anything like it before. He takes out his armour and lifts him down towards Earth. The other robot is not very happy that he can see what he wants. He sees that the other robot is scared by the noise and tears that he is being held to death. He tries to run away but the other robot holds his arm and moves faster than him. He makes a loud bang, which hurts the other robot's ears. The other alien hears the cry and runs back to Earth. He picks up the little robot and hugs him tight. He says sorry to the other robot and asks him why he was not letting go. The other robots say they are sorry too, because they had been fighting over something very important and were afraid of what might happen next. They say they will not fight anymore, because they have to work together as a team. The robot says he understands, but he knows that he should not be so greedy. He says he will not let go of the big things
