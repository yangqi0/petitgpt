 Once upon a time,  Partner was walking through the forest. The sun was shining and birds were singing. Suddenly, the ground started to shake! It was an earthquake! The ground shook so hard that it destroyed some of the trees in the forest. Everyone ran away from the shaking ground as fast as they could. After a while, the earthquake stopped. The people looked around, but all the trees had been destroyed by the earthquake. They felt very sad and went back home. When they got there, they saw that everything was still standing. But their village was ruined by something even more beautiful than before. All the houses had been destroyed in a big, messy mess.

 In a distant future, humans and robots  open up their minds to the world of astrophysics. As our friend and I met, we would never forget how much we were inspired by nature and the opportunity to meet new people in the world of the future. We are inspired by nature, love and kindness to share our stories with others and bring joy into the life we enjoy. This is a trip we’re taking for many years, but it can be hard to make the journey as long as we’ve been away from home, so that we can take time out of this amazing journey together. Here at this moment, we will be sharing our experiences of learning about new things and feeling connected to something more than what we have been taught before! The trip was held on Saturday afternoon, while the sun was shining, birds singing and children playing. We were all excited to learn and explore this new place. It’s filled with incredible memories of those adventures we’ve experienced over the past year. Let us begin exploring the wonderful sights of the world around us, so we can see how we can do more. On our second day, we woke up and packed up our things. We made sure to pack everything we needed, including snacks, drinks, books, and snacks. While we were travelling, we
