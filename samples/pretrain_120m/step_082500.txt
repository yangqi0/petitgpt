 Once upon a time, aimed his mother and father had a very special surprise. They told him they were going to take him on an adventure! So the two of them went outside in their car. The driver said he was going to show them something special - it was a big box with lots of buttons. He opened the box and revealed a brand new toy for his friend. It was a teddy bear that he had wanted for a long time. The driver was so happy when he saw how much fun his daughter and dad were having together. From then on, he always made sure to close the box tightly before leaving for home.

 In a distant future, humans and robots ints are going to be able to make it possible for humans to work more efficiently in the home. But what if human beings were just too busy making their lives better? The answer is that we need more time. After all, humans have to work harder, and more often than not. That’s why we should spend time with them now. We don’t want to waste time getting involved in our daily life. So let’s go ahead and give ourselves some good advice: - If you want to make sure you don’t get distracted by your activities, then take action. This will allow you to focus on yourself instead of running around and going out. - You can sleep more quickly as well. - When we get distracted, try to focus on things that are important to us. - Don’t be afraid to try something new every day. - Have a number of lessons that help you stay active, and feel comfortable doing this! - Be willing to take time to relax and enjoy life. - Be willing and take risks! - If you do start planning for your next big activity, then you’ll want to focus on being productive. Because of this, the next thing you know about living is that we must constantly be active. Here are some
