 Once upon a time, ometre-death event was expected to occur in the U.S., the National Science Foundation reported on Tuesday.
"We expect that the event will be observed by the U. S. Department of Energy and U. S." said Mike Lyle, the project's director for research at the University of California, San Diego. "It is expected to be very close to the end of the year."
The U.S. Geological Survey said it expected the event would be held at the U.N. site Monday night. The event will also be held at a private event that could be held from 6:30 p.m. until Sunday afternoon.

 In a distant future, humans and robots  unsuccessfully try to prevent the development of nuclear weapons.
"The time has come for the first human-made weapon to be used in the world," said Dr. Benny Smith, a professor at the University of California, San Diego. "We have learned that nuclear weapons are not the only weapons we use today."
In addition to the nuclear weapons, the United States is currently developing a new nuclear weapon to protect its citizens from atomic bombs. The United States is also developing a new type of bomb that can be used to bomb the earth.
"It's a very good idea that it will be a lot easier than any other weapon ever developed," said Drs. David H. Goggins, a professor of chemistry at the University College of Medicine in San Francisco. "I think we could use this weapon to build a better bomb."
The United States is now looking to develop a new nuclear weapons weapon with greater effectiveness than conventional weapons.
